## Python & SQLite

After you feel a small bit more with relational databases, I recommend learning a bit of Python for 2 main reasons:
1. Automation. You can use Python to do pretty much **anything**, but it's particularly useful or things you find yourself doing over and over and over again.
    1. [insert information](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/insert/) into your database for you
    1. [Update records](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/update/) in your database (maybe you want to keep track of when a record was last modified and don't want to manually type out the date and time)
    1. scrape web content with [BeautifuSoup4](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup) (which you might then want to insert into the database)
    1. rename and/or many files 
    1. combine [images into a single PDF file](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-convert-image-to-pdf-using-img2pdf-module/) **much** more quickly than with something like Adobe Reader
    1. open local files on your computer relevant to your database without you having to find them
1. You can build a user interface with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)


But let's not get ahead of ourselves. First we need to set up Python and play around with it a bit.

### 1. Install Python and select a text editor
