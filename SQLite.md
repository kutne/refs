## Getting acquainted with SQLite

### 1. Check out the first two parts of this tutorial at Data Carpentry. You can do more if you'd like, but definitely start with these two.
   - [Part 1: important information about terminology and the role of primary keys](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-socialsci/01-relational-database/index.html)
   - [Part 2: setting up and getting started with DB Browser for SQLite](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-socialsci/02-db-browser/index.html)

### 2. Take a look at this sample database diagram and think about what what you learned in the Data Carpentry tutorial.  
  How many tables are there?  
  What information does each table seem to capture?  
  Which tables refer to another table?

You can view descriptions of the tables [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/). 

### 3. Download the [sample database](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/), open it in DB Browser for SQLite, and explore how it is set up.  
  1. In DB Browswer, try to execute different different [SELECT statements](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-select/)  
  1. Experiment with manipulating those query results using [ORDER BY](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-order-by/) and [WHERE](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-where/) clauses  
  1. Try using the wildcards with the [LIKE](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-like/) operator
Whenever I need to figure out how to write a SQLite statement to execute, this tutorial is one of my first stops.
